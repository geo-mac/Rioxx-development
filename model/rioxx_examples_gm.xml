<dc:description>We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the impact of job search assistance on the employment of recently arrived refugees in Germany. The treatment group received job-matching support: an NGO identified suitable vacancies and sent the refugees’ CVs to employers. Six months after the start of the treatment, we find no evidence for positive treatment effects on employment. However, after twelve months, we detect positive treatment effects: marginally significant for the full sample and larger in magnitude and significant for lower educated refugees and those who have not yet received a refugee status. These individuals face higher uncertainty about their residence status, they do not search effectively, lack access to alternative support programmes and may be disregarded by employers due to perceived higher hiring costs. Our results suggest that personalised job search assistance can improve labour market integration of these refugee groups by alleviating labour market frictions.</dc:description>

## Questions

## Do we need 'format' as a Version of Record relation attribute?  <!-- I would say 'no', because we typically do not have authority of assertion -- however, we have to also accept that very occasionally a repository may be the publisher of a VoR. For example, Strathprints functions as an overlay journal and also an official location for conference paper publication. It therefore needs to remain as an option; just optional -->
## Do we need 'resource_exposed_date' as a Version of Record relation attribute? <!-- Same policy as 'format' -->
## Do we need 'license_start_date' to be an attribute of relation
