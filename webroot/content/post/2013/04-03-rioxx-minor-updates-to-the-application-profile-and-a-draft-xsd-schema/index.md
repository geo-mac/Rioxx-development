A minor update to the RIOXX application profile (v0.91) has been published, and a draft XSD schema intended for validation of RIOXX records has been made available. Comments  on either or both are welcome.


* [RIOXX application profile v0.91](http://www.rioxx.net/v0-91/)
* [RIOXX XSD schema](http://docs.rioxx.net/schema/v1.0/rioxx.xsd)


These releases should be considered as 'release candidates'. Work is under way to develop plugins/patches for both ePrints and DSpace to help institutional repositories to implement the guidelines and application profile. The technical specifications for this work will also be made freely available for developers to implement support for other platforms. The final version (1.0) of the RIOXX application profile will be released when this development work is complete.

Please feel free to comment on any of this work by emailing the RIOXX team at [admin@rioxx.net](mailto:admin@rioxx.net)
