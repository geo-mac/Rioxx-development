<p>We are please to announce that <a href="http://www.rioxx.net/v0-8/">version 0.8 of the guidelines and application profile is available for public comment</a>.</p>

<p>There is still some work to do, but we anticipate that the final version (1.0) will not depart from the current version significantly.</p>

<p>Please do comment on this version - it is quite likely that this will be the final public consultation before we publish version 1.0. You can comment either directly on the page or by emailing one of the <a href="http://www.rioxx.net/contact/">project team</a>.</p>
