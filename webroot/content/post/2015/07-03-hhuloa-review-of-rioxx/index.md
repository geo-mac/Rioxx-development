The universities of Hull, Huddersfield and Lincoln, collaborating as *HHuLOA*, have been analysing RIOXX 2.0 in the context of implementation within their various repository systems. While Lincoln and Huddersfield have deployed [ePrints](http://www.eprints.org/uk/), Hull has a [Hydra](http://projecthydra.org) repository. This is the first information I have seen from people intending to implement RIOXX in a Hydra system, so is very welcome!

You can read a [summary of their findings](https://library3.hud.ac.uk/blogs/hhuloa/2015/06/29/rioxx-review-and-proposed-practice/), or access the [full report (PDF)](https://library3.hud.ac.uk/blogs/hhuloa/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/06/HHuLOA-RIOXX-review.pdf)
