The RIOXX team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.0 of the RIOXX metadata application profile and guidelines.

The following resources are now available:

* [metadata application profile](/v2-0-final)
* [guidelines for repository managers](/guidelines)
* [XML Schema files and resources](/schema/v2.0/rioxx/)

The team would like to acknowledge the significant support in particular of Ben Ryan (RCUK) and Ben Johnson (HEFCE) in preparing this version 2.0 release, and would also like to thank the many contributors who have offered reviews, suggestions and corrections over the last few months. RIOXX 2.0 is a significantly improved metadata application profile thanks to the level and quality of input we have received from the community.

We would also like to thank Jisc for having provided funding and support for the crucial early stages in the development of the RIOXX application profile.
