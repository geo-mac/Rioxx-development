I'm very pleased to note that the number of [instituional repositories declaring support for RIOXX](http://rioxx.net/implementation/) has reached 30! This number has trebled in 6 months which is a healthy rate of adoption.

This is due to the growing adoption of the Jisc-funded ePrints plugin. It would be good to see some other systems listed: there are, I believe, ongoing developments to introduce RIOXX support into other repository systems.

Who will be next? Will it be DSpace? Will it be Hydra? Watch this space....
