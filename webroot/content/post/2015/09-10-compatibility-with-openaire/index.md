RIOXX operates in a similar space to OpenAIRE and so the RIOXX team at EDINA have been concerned to make the two metadata application profiles as mutually compatible as possible.
 
Working closely with the OpenAIRE team, we have prepared a document which explains how to 'map' properties from RIOXX 2.0 to OpenAIRE 3.0, with some guidance also on mapping terms in some of the controlled vocabularies.

[This 'crosswalk' document can be found here](http://rioxx.net/crosswalk_rioxx_2_0_openaire_3_0/).

We hope this is useful.
