_Rioxx: The Research Outputs Metadata Schema_ was developed for institutional repositories to share metadata about the scholarly resources they contain. Originally designed to meet the reporting requirements of [Research Councils UK (RCUK)](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk), Rioxx has also proven to be generally useful as a standard for sharing metadata between repositories and network services such as large-scale metadata aggregators (e.g. [Core](http://www.core.ac.uk)).

Rioxx focuses on applying consistency to the metadata fields used for identifiers of scholarly outputs, people and organisations, research funders and project/grants, and is designed to support the consistent tracking of open-access research publications across scholarly systems.

_Rioxx: The Research Outputs Metadata Schema_ is governed by [UKCORR](https://www.ukcorr.org), and its documentation (this website) is maintained by Paul Walk at [Antleaf](http://www.antleaf.com).
