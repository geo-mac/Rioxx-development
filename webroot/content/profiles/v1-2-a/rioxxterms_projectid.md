This is designed to collect the project IDs issued by funders that relate to the current resource. It is **REQUIRED** to use the alphanumeric identifier provided by the funder in its original format e.g. ST/K001234/1. Sometimes publications have more than one project ID associated with them; these **MUST** be recorded using separate instances of rioxxterms.projectid. In cases where projects have been funded internally, use whichever internal code is appropriate.
