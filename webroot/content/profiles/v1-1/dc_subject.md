Normally keywords, phrases or classification codes are used to describe the topic of the resource. If using free text, the use of general keywords **SHOULD** be avoided. It is **RECOMMENDED** to use a formal classification scheme or controlled vocabulary e.g Library of Congress Classification Headings or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). When including terms from multiple vocabularies, separate element iterations **MUST** be used. If multiple vocabulary terms or keywords are used, terms **SHOULD** be separated with one of the following approaches:

* the use of semi-colons to separate individual terms

or

* the use of separate iterations of this element for each term
