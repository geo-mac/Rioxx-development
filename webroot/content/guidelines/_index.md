*Deprecated*

These metadata [guidelines](/guidelines/RIOXX_Metadata_Guidelines_v_3.0.pdf) (PDF) were written to explain how the RIOXX metadata application profile should be understood and implemented. They were written for the RCUK version of RIOXX version 2 and are, therefore, **no longer current**.
